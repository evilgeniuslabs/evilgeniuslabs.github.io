### Details

Fibonacci512 is a giant, beautiful 320mm circular disc with 512 RGB LEDs surface mounted in a Fibonacci distribution. Swirling and pulsing like a colorful galaxy, it's mesmerizing to watch.

It consists of 512 WS2812B-Mini 3535 RGB LEDs, arranged into a circular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_spiral">Fermat's spiral</a> pattern.

I have created several LED art pieces in Fibonacci patterns.  They are all very labor intensive to create, and so are fairly expensive and limited in quantity.  I wanted to come up with a Fibonacci layout that was at least slightly easier to create, and therefore more affordable.

I have RGB LEDs in just about every form they come: strips, strings, rings, discs, etc.  The LEDs on most discs are arranged in very regular rings.  Fibonacci512 is different.  The LEDs are arranged in a Fibonacci distribution.  The makes the layout very organic and seemingly messy.  But with the proper animation, spiral patterns emerge with spectacular results.

Each of the 512 WS2812B-Mini 3535 RGB LEDs has its own decoupling capacitor built in.  The top and bottom of the PCB are large 5V and GND planes, to allow for the large amount of current required by the 512 LEDs.  The PCB is split into four separate data lines to allow for higher frame rates when driven by a microcontroller that supports the FastLED library's parallel output, such as ESP8266, ESP32, Teensy, etc. The max theoretical frame rate with four way parallel output is ~260 FPS. Each of the four data lines has a separate four-pin headers provided for 5V, Data In (to the section), Data Out (from the previous section) and GND. The last Data Out pin can be used to connect to even more LEDs. There are also small jumper solder pads that can be bridged to drive the whole panel with a single pin (max ~65 FPS), or two pins (max 130 FPS).

### Assembly Instructions

**Note**: Double-check the position, alignment, and orientation of each component very carefully before soldering!

If you're new to soldering, I highly recommend reading through a good soldering tutorial, such as the ones by [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering) and [SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering).

**Note**: Pictures are of the smaller [Fibonacci256](/fibonacci256), but the instructions are identical.

1. Find a clean spot on your soldering workspace. I used a piece of heavy card stock. Carefully place the board with the LEDs facing down and the bottom of the board facing up.
   <img src="https://imgur.com/dcH2g2E.png" class="img-responsive" />
2. I used [90 degree header pins](https://amzn.to/2Vzi2gU) to allow connecting and disconnecting jumper wires easily. I used small [female headers](https://amzn.to/2Vzi2gU) to keep them level while I soldered.
   <img src="https://imgur.com/oF0O5u5.png" class="img-responsive" />
3. Insert the header pins.
   <img src="https://imgur.com/SDp87ah.png" class="img-responsive" />
4. Carefully turn the board over and solder only the middle pin of each header.
   <img src="https://imgur.com/YafBoqC.png" class="img-responsive" />
5. Ensure the headers are straight and level before proceeding to solder the remaining pins. The 5V and GND pins are connected to planes with large traces, and may take some time to heat up enough for solder to melt. Using a higher temperature and less time can help, if possible. Flux can also help.
6. Check each solder joint, then disconnect the female headers.
7. **VERY** carefully check polarity before connecting 5V and GND. If possible, connect 5V and GND on both sets of headers to provide maximum current flow and minimize voltage drop. I used [female jumper wires](https://amzn.to/2vjvZ8e).
   <img src="https://imgur.com/XqbL1R8.png" class="img-responsive" />
8. Connect the data pin from your microcontroller to the DI pin on the Fibonacci board.
9. Each WS2812 can theoretically draw 60mA at full brightness, solid white color. 64 of them can theoretically draw 4 Amps! I strongly suggest using [FastLED's power management](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Power-notes#managing-power-in-fastled) to limit the maximum brightness to a reasonable amount, well under the maximum your power supply is rated for. I've found even just 2A from a USB power adapter is blindingly bright.
10. Keep an eye on the temperature of the PCB and especially the connectors. High temperatures can reduce the life of the LEDs. When possible, ensure air can flow, either passively (ventilation) or actively (exhaust fan).
11. Most header pins are rated for 4-6 amps, but be sure to check your pins and wires. High temperatures increase resistance, which increases temperature, ad infinitum. If temperatures exceed the maximum rating of the wire insulation, sparks and fire can occur at high amperage.

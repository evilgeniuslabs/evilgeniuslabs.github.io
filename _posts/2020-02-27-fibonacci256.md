### Details

Fibonacci256 is a beautiful 166mm circular disc with 256 RGB LEDs surface mounted in a Fibonacci distrubution.  Swirling and pulsing like a colorful galaxy, it's mesmerizing to watch.

It consists of 256 RGB LEDs, arranged into a circular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_spiral">Fermat's spiral</a> pattern.

### Assembly Instructions

**Note**: Double-check the position, alignment, and orientation of each component very carefully before soldering!

If you're new to soldering, I highly recommend reading through a good soldering tutorial, such as the ones by [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering) and [SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering).

1. Find a clean spot on your soldering workspace.  I used a piece of heavy card stock.  Carefully place the board with the LEDs facing down and the bottom of the board facing up.

2. I used [90 degree header pins](https://amzn.to/2Vzi2gU) to allow connecting and disconnecting jumper wires easily.  I used small [female headers](https://amzn.to/2Vzi2gU) to keep them level while I soldered.

3. Insert the header pins.

4. Carefully turn the board over and solder only the middle pin of each header.

5. Ensure the headers are straight and level before proceeding to solder the remaining pins.  The 5V and GND pins are connected to planes with large traces, and may take some time to heat up enough for solder to melt.  Using a higher temperature and less time can help, if possible.  Flux can also help.
6. Check each solder joint, then disconnect the female headers.
7. **VERY** carefully check polarity before connecting 5V and GND.  If possible, connect 5V and GND on both sets of headers to provide maximum current flow and minimize voltage drop.  I used [female jumper wires](https://amzn.to/2vjvZ8e).

8. Each WS2812 can theoretically draw 60mA at full brightness, solid white color.  256 of them can theoretically draw 15.36 Amps!  I strongly suggest using [FastLED's power management](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Power-notes#managing-power-in-fastled) to limit the maximum brightness to a reasonable amount, well under the maximum your power supply is rated for.  I've found even just 2A from a USB power adapter is blindingly bright.
9. Keep an eye on the temperature of the PCB and especially the connectors.  High temperatures can reduce the life of the LEDs.  When possible, ensure air can flow, either passively (ventilation) or actively (exhaust fan).
10. Most header pins are rated for 4-6 amps, but be sure to check your pins and wires.  High temperatures increase resistance, which increases temperature, ad infinitum.  If temperatures exceed the maximum rating of the wire insulation, sparks and fire can occur at high amperage.

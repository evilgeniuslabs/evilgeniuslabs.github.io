### Details

Fibonacci64 Micro HDR is a beautiful 40mm circular disc with 64 RGB LEDs surface mounted in a Fibonacci distribution. Swirling and pulsing like a miniature galaxy, it's mesmerizing to watch.

It consists of 64 SK9822-EC2020 HDR (High Dymanic Range) RGB LEDs, arranged into a circular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_spiral">Fermat's spiral</a> pattern.

<a class="btn btn-success" href="https://www.tindie.com/products/23597">Buy on Tindie</a>

It has solder pads on the back that match the pinout of a [Pixelblaze V3 Pico by ElectroMage](https://shop.electromage.com/products/pixelblaze-v3-pico-tiny-wifi-led-controller), [QT Py by Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=qt+py), or [XIAO by Seeed](https://www.seeedstudio.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=xiao). It can be used by any microcontroller via the 5V, GND, Clock and Data In pins.

### Pixelblaze Map

[Pixelblaze](https://www.bhencke.com/pixelblaze) is an advanced WiFi LED pattern engine, created by [ElectroMage](https://electromage.com). Live pattern expression compiler, lightning fast fixed point math, and HDR!

Fibonacci boards are laid out physically in a zig-zag pattern, from center to edge and back to center, all the way around the board. This layout automatically makes one dimensional patterns designed for strips visually interesting.

To treat the board as a matrix, you can use a pixel map. A 2D XY map can allow you to scroll colors, palettes, and patterns across the panel horizontally, vertically, diagonally, etc.

This map can be copied and pasted into the Pixel Mapper in the Mapper tab of your Pixelblaze web interface.

### Acrylic Open Case Assembly Instructions

1. Peel and remove any protective plastic and/or paper film from the acrylic.
1. Insert M2x10mm Button Head Hex Screws into the holes in the matte side of the acrylic face plate.
1. Hand-tighten M2 Hex Metal Nuts onto the screws, on the glossy side of the acrylic face plate.
1. Carefully center and place the Fibonacci PCB onto the standoffs, with the LED side facing the glossy side of the acrylic face plate.
1. Hand-tighten M2 Nylon Hex Standoffs onto the back side of the Fibonacci PCB.
1. Center and place the acrylic back plate onto the standoffs.
1. Hand-tighten M2 Hex Nuts onto the standoffs.
1. Use flush cutters to trim off any excess nylon thread from the standoffs that is extending past the nuts on the back of the enclosure.

### Assembly Instructions

**Note**: Double-check the position, alignment, and orientation of each component very carefully before soldering!

If you're new to soldering, I highly recommend reading through a good soldering tutorial, such as the ones by [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering) and [SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering).

<img src="https://imgur.com/BTdKtF9.png" class="img-responsive" />

1. Find a clean spot on your soldering workspace. I used a piece of heavy card stock. Carefully place the board with the LEDs facing down and the bottom of the board facing up.
1. **VERY** carefully check polarity before connecting 5V and GND.
1. Either:
  * Solder wires to the pads on the back of the Fibonacci PCB and connect them to your microcontroller.
  * Or:
  * Carefully align a Pixelblaze V3 Pico Adafruit QT Py, Seeeduino XIAO, or another controller with an identical footprint with the pads on the back of the Fibonacci PCB. Solder the pads.
1. Each SK9822-EC2020 can theoretically draw 15mA at full brightness, solid white color. 64 of them can theoretically draw 960mA. I've found that 960mA is blindingly bright.
1. If using a Pixelblaze V3 Pico, I suggest using the low power settings to reduce the CPU clock speed and/or disable wi-fi to reduce power usage and heat.
1. If using FastLED, I suggest using its [power management](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Power-notes#managing-power-in-fastled) to limit the maximum brightness to a reasonable amount, well under the maximum your power supply is rated for.
1. Keep an eye on the temperature of the PCB and especially the connectors. High temperatures can reduce the life of the LEDs. When possible, ensure air can flow, either passively (ventilation) or actively (exhaust fan).

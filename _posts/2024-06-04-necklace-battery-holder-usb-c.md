### Details

Necklace battery holder for 14500 size 4.2V lithium batteries with USB-C plug on the end for connecting to 1" Fibonacci and other devices powered via USB-C.

Wear your small LED devices around your neck, on the go!

### Precautions

- <b><u>NEVER</u> insert the battery into the holder with the wrong orientation!</b> Doing so will reverse the polarity of the circuit and is highly likely to damage the electronics inside the device. The battery holder is designed to prevent reverse polarity contact, but it is still possible.
- <b><u>NEVER</u> use AA alkaline batteries!</b> Doing so will under-power the circuitry and is highly likely to damage the electronics inside the device.
- **NEVER** insert the USB-C plug of the battery holder into any other USB-C socket of any charger, computer, laptop, tablet or other device.
- Use only button top 4.2V Lithium Ion batteries.
  A button-top Li-Ion 14500 battery has a small “nub” on the positive terminal.
- The device and battery holder contain live electronic components that are not water-resistant.
  Please store them away from moisture and keep them from getting wet – especially while being worn.
- Please handle your device with care as the wires holding the device contain a live electrical circuit.
  The device will stand up to normal daily wear but is not designed to handle excessive strain.
- Pulling firmly on the device or wiring may cause the clasp to disconnect while it is worn,
  and the device may come loose and fall if this happens.
  Do not wear your device anywhere that you think it may catch easily.
  This easy-release mechanism allows for quick removal of the device and disconnection of the circuit, should damage occur to the electronics while the device is being worn.
- For more information on safe operation and storage of LiIon batteries, please see [this safety sheet from the National Fire Protection Association](https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/Public-Education/Resources/Safety-tip-sheets/LithiumIonBatterySafety.ashx#:~:text=Keep%20batteries%20at%20room%20temperature.&text=Do%20not%20place%20batteries%20in,keep%20them%20in%20hot%20vehicles.&text=Store%20batteries%20away%20from%20anything,%2C%20toys%2C%20and%20even%20cars.)

### Instructions

1. The battery comes inserted and taped inside the holder, with a piece of polyamide tape over the positive battery terminal for safety during shipping. All of the tape will need to be removed before use.

1. All of the parts of the necklace battery holder, from left to right: USB-C to USB-A charging cable, battery, necklace battery holder. The black disc is a 1" Fibonacci128 and may not be included if you ordered the battery holder separately.

1. The USB-C to USB-A battery charging cable.

1. Insert the oval-shaped USB-C plug into the USB-C socket in the positive end of the battery. Press gently but firmly until it snaps and locks into place. Plug the other end of the cable into any USB-A port (wall wart charger, power bank, computer, etc).

   You can use any standard USB-C cable.

   The light will turn red while charging, then turn green when fully charged.

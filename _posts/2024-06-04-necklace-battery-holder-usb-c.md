1. Insert the oval-shaped USB-C plug into the USB-C socket in the positive end of the battery. Press gently but firmly until it snaps and locks into place. Plug the other end of the cable into any USB-A port (wall wart charger, power bank, computer, etc).
   You can use any standard USB-C cable.
   The light will turn red while charging, then turn green when fully charged.

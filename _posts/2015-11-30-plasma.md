Plasma is a spherical light art display.

The outer surface is a hard spherical plastic shell.  Encased within is a translucent foam core, which provides great diffusion of the light from the RGB LEDs.

Inside, two 24 NeoPixel rings are driven with a Particle Photon using the FastLED library.

A LSM303DLHC triple-axis accelerometer and magnetometer is embedded in the center, allowing for animations that interact through movement and rotation.

It's powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery.

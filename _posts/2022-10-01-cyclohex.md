### Details

CycloHex is a beautiful set of hexagonally-nested rings with 228 RGB LEDs, six touch pads, and mounting pads for an Adafruit QT Py SAMD21.

I have RGB LEDs in just about every form they come: strips, strings, rings, discs, etc.  I constantly seek new and novel forms.

The WS2812C-2020 each only consume a maximum of 15mA, and that's at 100% brightness, solid white color.  That's 3.42A for all 228 combined. They are incredibly bright, and I usually only run them at about 25% brightness.

It has solder pads on the back that match the pinout of the [QT Py by Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=qt+py), or [XIAO by Seeed](https://www.seeedstudio.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=xiao). It can be used by any microcontroller via the 5V, GND, and Data In pins. It also has a Data Out pad, for connecting more LEDs on the same data pin.

The six mounting holes are surrounded by capacitive touch compatible pads. They're connected to the A0-A3, A6 & A7 pads/pins on the QT Py footprint. The SAMD21 QT Py supports capacitive touch on these pins. Most other QT Py / XIAO boards, such as the RP2040, do not support capacitive touch.
